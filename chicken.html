      <p> chicken legs</p>
      <p> masa harina flour,</p>
      <p> 4 eggs, </p>
      <p> paprika,</p>
      <p> canola oil, </p>
      <p> salt,</p>

      <div class= "instructions">
        <p>You start by creating a dredging system. You lay out masa harina in one
          tray and beaten eggs in another. In the tray of masa harina, you season the flour with
        cayenne, paprika, and salt, because a true champion is able to keep cool while facing
      the heat. </p>
        <p>
          You season the chicken with salt and pepper, because only a LOSER would let his chicken
          be underseasoned and you aren't a loser, right? You're a true boss, a true Champion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the chicken is seasoned, you dip the legs into the masa tray, shaking off the excess
          flour before you plunge them into a deluge of eggs. You repeat this process again, to build the
          most crispy outside layer for your chicken, chockful of seasoning and flavor.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's time: frying time. You heat up your oil until it reaches 350 degrees fahrenheit, and in the
            process, making your house smell like the baby of a waffle house dumpster mixed with the Gulf of
            Mexico in 2010. But you disregard the complaints from your suitemates about the wafting odors now
            permeating your surroundings. For you are a champion, and the simple minds of the general population
            could never fathom the genius vested in yourself. You place in your drumsticks and let out a sigh of content
            as the oil crackles and emitts the most satisfying bubbling noises.</p>

            <p> You fry these legs until they are G.B.D, Golden, Brown, Delicious. After marveling over these
              golden nuggets of the culinary world, you place them on a plate lined with paper towel to sop up
              some of the grease. After all, a true winner is put together, not a sweaty slob.</p>

            <p> You eat almost immediately after the chicken has been drained of oil, for humble people serve the
              food, hungry people are the ones who eat.</p>
