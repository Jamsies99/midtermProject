      <p> a muddler,</p>
      <p> a glass,</p>
      <p> a straw, </p>
      <p> a cinnamon stick, </p>
      <p> a star anise clove,
      <p> a thai chili pepper, </p>
      <p> 8 mint leaves,</p>
      <p> 2 ounces of setlzer,</p>
      <p> 2 ounces of white rum, </p>
      <p> .5 ounce of lime juice,</p>
      <p> a pot of lemongrass syrup,</p>
      <p> and ice cubes.</p>
      </div>

          Inside of the cup, you drop the mint leaves inside with .75 ounces of the lemongrass
          syrup and rum. The lemongrass syrup smells wildly exotic, as it has been simmered
          with a cup of sugar and water for 30 minutes, allowing for the citric flavors of
          the lemongrass to infuse with the syrup.
         </p>

        <p> At this point, you face a daunting task that recquires great discipline:
          releasing the flavor and scents from the mint by pressing the mint using the
          muddler. Applying too much pressure during this extraction will result in
          chlorophyll being released, which will lead your expedition to a bitter end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this danger, you are fearless in the face of adversity. You chuckle
            with amusement when others would shudder in fear. The mint leaves are perfectly
            extracted. You then place a few ice cubes inside of the cube and then top of the drink
            with seltzer.
          </p>
          <p>
            To further augment your drink, you go all the way and then a little more. By topping
            it with a chili pepper, star anise, and a cinnamon It would
            not be a far stretch to say that you embark on a flavor safari.
