    <h1>You come home from a long day at school. It was horrible and you want to lift your spirits up
    on something tasty, and easy to make. After searching your pantry you find the following:</h1>
<!--ingredient/ material list -->
<div class= imageMaterial >
    <div class = "materials">
      <p> a cutting board,</p>
      <p> a knife,</p>
      <p> 1/2 cup of olive oil, <p>
      <p> 1/2 head of garlic, </p>
      <p> a bottle of red pepper flakes,</p>
      <p> 1/2 of a lemon,</p>
      <p> 1/3 cup of parsley, </p>
      <p> salt </p>
      <p> and pepper. </p>

      <div class= "instructions">
        <p> You start with starting to boil your water to cook your pasta. However, now is not the time to
          squander precious seconds! The outcome of this dish is heavily determined by your precise timing.</p>

      <p>Wasting no time, you commence the preparation of your ingredients. You finely chop your parsley into
        miniscule morsels. </p>
      <p>By pressing in the center of the head of garlic,you're able to separate
        all of the cloves. You remove the outside skin by using your fingertips, revealing
        the pungent innards. </p>

      <p> To break down the garlic into smaller pieces, you utilize your emotions, and you treat the garlic as a
        form of stress relief. By placing the knife's flat side over the garlic, and then smashing the knife
        with a closed fist, you find some sort of comfort in this otherwise mundane process of prepping. </p>

      <p> Around this time, your water will have reached a boil. Right before you're about to put in the pasta, you
        remember to season your water heavily with salt, as nothing is worse then having underseasoned pasta in a
        pasta dish. You slowly place the pasta inside the boiling water to avoid any splashes and set your timer
      two minutes less then what is recommended on the packaging </p>

      <p>While the pasta begins to cook, the time is ripe for you to assemble the sauce. You add olive oil to a
        sauce pan, and heat under medium heat. Once the oil has been heated, you toss in the garlic and fry until
        the garlic is golden brown, and smells very fragant. Desiring a little bit a heat, you add a pinch of
      red pepper flakes.  </p>

      <p> Around this time, your timer for the pasta goes off. You grab about a 1/4 cup of pasta water
        to add later to the sauce, and strain the pasta. With a loud sizzle, you add your pasta to the sauce pan.
        Moments later, this sizzle morphs into a thunderous roar as you add the reserved pasta water. </p>

      <p> After a few minutes, you're greeted by a thick sauce, as the starches in the pasta water have combined with
        the oil. You toss the pasta and make sure that everything is evenly coated, while adding the juice from the lemon.
        You throw in parsley too, so to add some contrast to the rest of the dish.

        <p> you take roughly 1/2 of the pasta and place it on your plate. Before you dig in, you admire your masterpiece.
          While the contrast with the parsley is great, you decide to add some ground pepper to further diversify the color
          of the dish.</p>
